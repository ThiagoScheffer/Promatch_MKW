# Promatch - Fun Mod for Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare

**Promatch** was originally a competitive mod for **Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare**, designed to offer advanced and customizable gameplay. However, as the professional competitive scene for **Call of Duty 4** has been dead for many years, **Promatch** evolved into a mod primarily aimed at **fun**, with custom weapons, game modes, and bot systems for a more relaxed and enjoyable experience.

The mod became incredibly popular on my own server, where players enjoyed it for over **8 years**. Unfortunately, since I have moved on and there aren’t as many players anymore, the server is now closed. But it was an amazing journey filled with great moments with friends and countless hours of coding, testing, and improving the mod.
